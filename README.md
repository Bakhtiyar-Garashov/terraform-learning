# Terraform learning

This repo contains test scripts and tutorials used during my learning journey of Terraform. Learning path consists of folders which contain learning guide/document and test scripts for that particular day. I didn't give a fancy name ("xxx-days-of-terraform") to the repository as I am not sure at all how long it will take to learn the concepts. So, let's start with the [day 1](./Day_01/day_01.md)
